    <p>My name is <span class="titles"> Manuel Camilion</span>, and I am a Film Director. I work with actors, producers, crew, and drink way too much caffeine. <br> Currently, I am in my third year studying Motion Pictures at the University of Miami. I have worked in big productions ranging <br>from Horror to Drama, and am looking to find more stories to tell.
